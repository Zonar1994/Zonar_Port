                From this study, I learned that integrating AI thoughtfully into organizational processes can most
                definitely enhance values and efficiency. Due to the nature of generative AI, it can act as a
                brainstorming partner or a project manager assistant that can scope large quantities of information or
                data.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I learned from this study that AI can be used to support human intelligence, fostering a
                collaborative environment where human creativity is enhanced. This is important to remember for the
                system that I am building.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, I also need to take into account that these systems need to be ethical and have a human-centric
                approach. This is crucial, ensuring that AI doesn't take over but extends our capabilities.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Concluding the Ideation Phase, I explored the potential of AI integration within organizations. Through
                defining research questions, conducting a comprehensive literature study, performing a detailed
                comparative analysis, and gaining insights from a key stakeholder interview, I have established a solid
                foundation for the next steps. The insights gained include the necessity of AI for automating complex
                tasks, understanding dependencies, and providing structured guidance for project planning. Moving into
                the Specification & Design phase, these ideas will be further developed into concrete prototypes.
                <br><br>
                In the next phase, I will focus on refining and implementing the concepts proposed during the Trigger
                Phase, such as the Attribute Extender and Reverse Engineering tools. The Reverse Engineering tool will
                focus on dissecting projects into actionable tasks to streamline project management and execution. Due
                to time constraints and the sheer amount of development needed to develop both concepts, I will mainly
                focus on the Reverse Engineering or Breakdown Bot tool. By incorporating the insights, I aim to create
                AI tools that enhance efficiency and support strategic decision-making, ensuring they are adaptable and
                future-proof. This groundwork ensures that the project progresses with a clear understanding of AI's
                potential impacts and practical applications in enhancing organizational efficiency and creativity.
                <br><br>
                Next to that, I think it is important to realize that I will not be covering all research questions, but
                focusing on the proof-of-concept to show how it would work. The ethical considerations and research
                questions will then be addressed by simply ideating and coming up with protocols or restrictions for
                this system. These will be covered in the Evaluation Phase.
