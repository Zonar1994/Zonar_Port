            <h1>Evaluation Phase</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                In this evaluation, I assess the efficiency and effectiveness of using AI models for dissecting and
                managing complex projects. These models excel at breaking down projects into manageable tasks, which can
                be looped repeatedly for further dissection. By multiplying the agents and creating additional
                databases, the process can be extended to finer levels of detail.
                <br><br>
                The output generated by these AI models is notably accurate and factual, aligning well with my firsthand
                knowledge of the projects that I used as an example. I used a Business model canvas as an example, which is something I am quite familiar and my coworkers as well. Given the example . the AI successfully creates
                actionable tasks that other agents can further process or perform.The approach of both of the Project Breakdown bots ensures that
                each step is clear, specific, and conducive to automation.
                <br><br>
                Beyond my self-evaluation, I have still yet to get feedback from my coworkers to gain additional insights and validate
                the effectiveness of the AI-driven project management system. I will be detailing their perspectives
                during the graduation session.

                looped to further dissect tasks, demonstrating significant scalability by multiplying agents and
                creating more databases. The outputs generated are accurate and align well with my firsthand knowledge
                of the Business Model Canvas and established practices. The tasks created are highly actionable and can
                be seamlessly integrated into further workflows, enhancing productivity and efficiency. The
                implementation of these models has been enlightening, revealing their potential for significant time
                savings and improved task management. Overall, the AI Bots have proven to be valuable tools for
                managing and dissecting complex projects, providing practical and relevant tasks that align with
                real-world examples.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>
                Project Focus and Development
                The primary focus of this project was to develop a Project Breakdown Bot designed to assist project
                managers by breaking down projects into actionable tasks that can be assigned to either an employee or
                an AI agent. This system allows managers to enter project details, which the bot then dissects into
                manageable tasks. Utilizing n8n, Notion, and the OpenAI API, I created a user-friendly system within
                Notion. This setup could enable project managers to dissect projects by simply entering details and clicking
                a button, which triggers the AI agent via n8n with a webhook and API.
                <br><br>
                <b>Self-Evaluation and Findings</b><br>
                The system was evaluated against the requirements and criteria defined in the project's initial phases.
                While it did not meet all the more complex criteria, it adhered to most, such as the ability to dissection projects and it's 
                ease of use. The system's ability to break down projects into actionable tasks was surprisingly
                effective, provided detailed input was given. The bot excelled at breaking down projects such as the
                Business Model Canvas into tasks such as the larger segments of the BMC and smaller tasks that involved contacting clients, visiting websites, gathering
                information, and creating interview plan. This demonstrates the bot's potential to act as a
                valuable "brainstorming partner" to project managers.
                <br><br>
                <b>Insights and Organizational Fit</b><br>
                The system's performance depends heavily on the quality of input dataâ€”detailed project information
                results in more accurate and actionable task breakdowns, aligning with the principle of "garbage in,
                garbage out." However, the system may not fit all organizational workflows. It is more suitable for
                design or development companies where detailed project planning is crucial. On the other hand, it might not be
                as effective for production companies with more intricate and less predictable workflows.
                <br><br>
                <b>Benefits and Limitations</b><br>
                The primary benefits include significant time savings and providing project managers with a "sparring
                partner" for brainstorming and project dissection. The system enhances project management efficiency by
                automating the breakdown process. However, the system's main limitation is its dependence on detailed
                input data. It struggled with less concrete tasks when provided with minimal information. The more
                detailed the data, the better the system's performance.
                <br><br>
                <b>Final Testing and Peer Review</b><br>
                In the final two weeks of my internship, I plan to test the system with colleagues and experts at
                Henhouse using the <a href="https://cmdmethods.nl/cards/showroom/peer-review" target="_blank"><b>Peer Review</b></a> method from CMD methods. This will provide valuable insights and help validate
                the system's functionality and applicability. If the feedback reveals any shortcomings, I will use these
                insights to recommend future improvements.
                <br><br>

                This project successfully demonstrated the potential of Generative AI in enhancing project management
                workflows. The Project Breakdown Bot proved effective in breaking down complex projects into actionable
                tasks, provided detailed input was given. While there are areas for improvement and adaptation, the
                proof of concept shows significant promise in automating and streamlining project breakdown processes.
                The final weeks of testing and peer review will provide the necessary validation and pave the way for
                future developments in this area.

            <h2> Recommendation</h2>
            <b>Improvement Areas</b><br>
            One key area for improvement is the prompt engineering. Enhancing this aspect could involve developing a
            scrutiny bot that rates the generated tasks and highlights areas for improvement. This would allow
            project managers to quickly identify and refine tasks, ensuring higher quality and more actionable
            outputs.
            <br>
            The main issue encountered was the inconsistency in the API output, which affected the structured JSON
            format required to populate the Notion database correctly. Addressing this inconsistency is crucial for
            ensuring smooth integration and functionality.
            <br>
            <b>User Feedback</b><br>
            The system's feedback from colleagues and experts is expected to provide insights into its usability and
            effectiveness. Preliminary feedback suggests the need for a more intuitive user interface and clearer
            instructions for inputting project details. The Peer review method from CMD will be employed to gather
            comprehensive feedback in the final weeks.
            <br>
            <b>Scalability and Adaptation</b><br>
            The system can be easily scaled by creating additional bots and integrating them into various databases.
            Adjusting certain parameters will enable the system to loop and generate tasks until the project manager
            is satisfied. This flexibility allows the system to adapt to different project sizes and complexities.
            <br>
            For different types of organizations, such as production companies, the system may need further
            customization. Integrating real-time data processing and workflow tracking capabilities can make it more
            suitable for such environments.
            <br>
            <b>Tool and Technology Enhancements</b><br>
            Using different AI models in the future can provide varied outputs and potentially more creative
            solutions, which can be beneficial for different types of companies. Exploring multiple models will
            enhance the system's adaptability and output quality.
            <br>
            <b>User Training and Implementation</b><br>
            Minimal training is required for project managers to use the system effectively, as it primarily
            involves filling in a database in Notion. However, setting up the system initially can be complex. Once
            a developer configures it, project managers can use the system repeatedly without further technical
            assistance.
            <br>
            <b>Prompt engineering with Tree of Thoughts Method</b><br>
            The Tree of Thoughts method for prompting has proven highly effective in ensuring that AI systems adhere to
            a specific method and think in structured steps. This approach forces the AI to break down tasks into
            manageable segments, enhancing its ability to generate coherent and actionable outputs. While there are
            other methods to explore, such as chain-of-thought prompting, they can be more complex and might require
            different system configurations. For this project, the Tree of Thoughts method has been instrumental in
            maintaining clarity and precision in task generation.
            <br>
            <b>Ethical Considerations and Best Practices</b><br>
            It is crucial to consider the types of projects inputted into the system to ensure ethical use.
            Fortunately, the GPT API has safeguards to prevent the creation of harmful tasks. Project managers must
            remain vigilant and ensure the system is used responsibly.
            <br>
            Establishing ethical guidelines for data privacy, security, and transparency is essential. Regular
            audits and feedback loops should be implemented to maintain ethical standards and best practices.
            <br>
           <b> Future Development</b><br>
            Future developments should focus on integrating multiple agents that provide department-specific
            feedback on tasks. This collaborative approach ensures that tasks are comprehensive and consider all
            necessary departmental requirements. Additional features such as real-time collaboration, predictive
            analytics, and automated reporting will further enhance the system's functionality.
