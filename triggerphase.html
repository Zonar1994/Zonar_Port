            <h1>Trigger Phase</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Trigger Phase serves as an exploration phase, capturing initial ideas, insights, and reasons for the
                project's initiation. It involves identifying triggers or inspirations that justify the project's need
                and establishing a foundation for further development. This phase ensures that the project is grounded
                in solid reasoning and aligned with broader organizational goals.
                <br><br>
                The project was started to explore how generative AI can improve organizational workflows. Henhouse
                Studio wants an innovative approach to identify significant opportunities to enhance creativity and
                efficiency in workplaces by augmenting human capabilities with generative AI. Many organizations can
                benefit from the capabilities that generative AI offers, such as automating repetitive tasks and
                allowing employees to focus on strategic and creative activities. The rapid advancements in AI and
                machine learning technologies provided the perfect opportunity to leverage these tools for
                organizational improvement.
            </p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>The primary goal of this project is to explore how generative AI, particularly large language models
                (LLMs), can enhance and optimize workflow processes within organizations. The focus is on leveraging
                AI's capabilities to process and analyze large amounts of information, break down complex data, and
                integrate knowledge effectively into everyday work processes. By focusing on a specific component, the
                project aims to show how generative AI can improve organizational workflows.</p>

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>With the Creative Technology methodology, it is important to have a vision, an intricate personal view on
                the project. It articulates the long-term goals and aspirations of a project, providing direction and
                inspiration. This is mainly an out-of-reach idea that will not be achieved during this internship but
                acts as a grounding pillar for the project, ensuring that the thought process and motivation stay
                consistent within this project. The next section contains the statement of my vision on the future of
                AI. </p>

                        future where technology and creativity merge seamlessly. By integrating AI as a collaborative
                        partner, we can enhance productivity, redefine workflows, and achieve a transformative shift in
                        work-life balance.</i>

                Henhouse believes in working smart, not hard. This means they are currently working with tools that are
                quite easy to use but are quite powerful at the same time. For the development of systems, I was
                strongly advised to check out n8n. They offer a low-code platform that allows you to create agents with
                generative AI. These agents act as assistants that can perform actions or process data on your behalf.
                n8n can easily be integrated with Notion, another tool Henhouse strongly advised. Notion acts as a
                database to store all of the information and is also the front-end part of the system, where users or
                project managers can interact with the system.
                <br>
                Next to that, I also wanted to outline a few proposed concepts that were given to me in the first few
                weeks. These are quick rough concepts of components that will be added to the system over time. I will
                work on one of these components for my internship. Knowing this, I wanted to hold a brainstorming
                session to dive deeper into these subjects with the tools in mind.

            <p>To the Trigger Phase, I conducted a brainstorming session focused on the project's main themes.
                This session was essential for generating a broad range of initial ideas and concepts. All thoughts
                were
                captured on sticky notes and organized on a Miro board, which helped categorize them effectively.
                Subsequently, I compiled these ideas into a list and used ChatGPT to create a word cloud. This
                visualization provided a clear overview of potential project directions, ensuring that our further
                explorations were aligned and cohesive.</p>

                In response to the challenges and opportunities identified, this project utilizes

                <a href="https://www.notion.so/product?utm_source=affl&utm_medium=katychmela3457&pscd=affiliate.notion.so&ps_partner_key=a2F0eWNobWVsYTM0NTc&ps_xid=CkXBwdkahCMaVG&gsxid=CkXBwdkahCMaVG&gspk=a2F0eWNobWVsYTM0NTc&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjLGyBhCYARIsAPqTz1-N5ZtKcgGvZihpuNU_n8Nir_QIaDsHiscQanrVegFso6STzJZU-aUaAs9nEALw_wcB"
                    target="_blank"><u><b>Notion</b></u></a>,
                and the
                <a href="https://openai.com/api/" target="_blank"><u><b>OpenAI ChatGPT-4 API</b></u></a>
                as foundational tools for developing a prototype. <b>N8N</b> will serve as the backbone for
                <b>automation and workflow management</b>, enabling the connection and automation of various tasks and
                data points across systems. We selected <b>n8n</b> for two main reasons: firstly, Henhouse Studio
                already uses it for everyday tasks, ensuring familiarity and ease of integration. Secondly, <b>n8n</b>
                is a very easy-to-use low-code tool that allows users to drag and drop code snippets together, creating
                automations in a blink of an eye.
                <br><br>
                <b>Notion</b> will act as the <b>central database</b>, organizing and storing all project-related
                information in a <b>user-friendly format</b>. Although we could use other databases, <b>Notion</b>'s
                interface is particularly user-friendly and intuitive. This allows for the creation of automations while
                instantly and clearly seeing where and how data is stored. Henhouse Studio's regular use of
                <b>Notion</b> further justifies its selection for this project.
                <br><br>
                The <b>OpenAI ChatGPT-4 API</b> will be leveraged for advanced data <b>processing</b> and <b>content
                    generation</b>, providing sophisticated AI capabilities to enhance the overall functionality and
                effectiveness of the prototype.
                By choosing these tools, we ensure that the project is built on a foundation of familiarity, ease of
                use, and advanced technological capabilities, aligning with our goals of improving organizational
                workflows through generative AI.
