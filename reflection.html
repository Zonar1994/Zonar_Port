            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I have been working at Henhouse for a little over a year now, and we have been trying to figure out how
                we can use generative AI to speed up processes within organizational workflows. We were mainly focusing
                on how we can improve repetitive tasks and let AI agents handle them. After a lot of experimenting and
                conceptualizing, we developed the Project Breakdown Bot idea, and I decided to work on that during my
                internship.
<br><br>
                It was quite difficult at first to scope these projects and figure out how to tackle them. Before I even
                started with the Project Breakdown Bot, I wanted to see if there were other things I could work on with
                generative AI. However, after conducting research and interviews, I decided to focus only on the Project
                Breakdown Bot and leave the Attribute Extender on hold. This was because I wanted to make sure I could
                experiment and try out different methods instead of trying to create an entire AI system for
                organizations that could do everything. Narrowing the scope resulted in a more detailed and concrete
                approach.
                <br><br>
                Due to the complexity and daunting nature of the project, it was difficult to decide what to include and
                exclude from the scope. Additionally, the AI landscape is constantly changing, with new insights
                emerging every week. This made it challenging to determine the best approach to the project and which
                components to focus on.
                <br><br>
                At first, it was tricky to make time to incorporate my approach and results into my portfolio and update
                it in a timely manner. Because I enjoy experimenting and trying things out, I often forgot to document
                everything. However, I eventually set aside one day each week to focus solely on my portfolio, which
                proved to be very effective. I received consistent feedback from my internship coach and made it a point
                to update my portfolio every week. This allowed me to get a better grip on the process and showed me
                that I need to be more proactive about documenting my work. I have learned to do this over the years,
                and I can say that I am now far better at consistently documenting my work in a concrete and concise
                manner than when I started this education.
                <br><br>
                This internship made me realize what kind of professional I am becoming in the IT space. With the
                Creative Technology internship, I had the chance to experiment with and explore various tools, create
                things, and show my progress to my manager. This back-and-forth process and the development of
                recommendations appeals to me the most, and it is something I excel at. Understanding the context and
                the requirements for a project or concept is a strength I demonstrated during this internship. With the
                different types of research and experiments I have conducted, I can confidently say that I can provide
                valuable recommendations for a company. I would like to focus on this area more and aim to become an AI
                consultant for IT companies. I have recommended countless things to my manager, explaining which AI
                models to use and what kind of prompting should be used in these systems. I was confident and accurate
                with my recommendations, which paid off with the project. I could create the things I set out to do from
                the beginning.
