        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>During the Realisation phase, I focused on transforming the proposed concepts into a working system by
                building the N8N logic, setting up the Notion database, and integrating OpenAI assistants. These tools
                were essential for creating a functional prototype that serves as a solid foundation for the proof of
                concept I am working on. This phase demonstrates how generative AI can enhance workflow processes,
                providing a hands-on example of AI-driven automation in project management. Here, I'll walk you through
                the system I developed, detailing each step and the rationale behind the choices made. Specifically, I
                developed Breakdown Bot 1 and Breakdown Bot 2 to dissect projects into actionable tasks, showcasing the
                potential of AI-driven automation.</p>
            <h2>Project Objectives and Approach</h2>

            <h3>Project Objectives:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficiency: Automate the breakdown of projects into actionable tasks.</li>
                <li>Clarity: Ensure tasks are clear and manageable.</li>
                <li>Integration: Seamlessly connect different tools for a streamlined workflow.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Design a system that can be expanded and adapted to various project needs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Approach:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify Requirements: Understand the needs and constraints of the project.</li>
                <li>Select Tools: Choose appropriate tools (N8N, Notion, OpenAI) based on their capabilities and how
                    they meet project requirements.</li>
                <li>Design Workflow: Create a workflow that integrates these tools to automate and manage tasks
                    effectively.</li>
                <li>Develop and Test: Build the system, test its functionality, and iterate based on feedback and
                    performance.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Utilizing N8N for Automation</h3>
            <li><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="" target="_blank">N8N Documentation</a></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <p>With the low-code tool N8N, I could easily create these systems and ensure they adhered to the system
                requirements defined in the Specification & Design phase. To achieve this, I made sure the system was
                transparent and easy to use. I implemented functions that allowed users to see the status, change it,
                and also alter it. Despite being a low-code platform, N8N can sometimes be challenging due to certain
                complexities in passing data through the nodes. Fortunately, I received assistance from coworkers
                whenever I encountered difficulties, ensuring the system's smooth functionality. For more details, refer
                to the <a href="pdf/n8nbreakdownbots.pdf" target="_blank">N8N and Notion Documentation</a>.</p>
            <h4>Why N8N?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-Code Efficiency: Reduces development time and complexity.</li>
                <li>Flexibility: Allows for complex workflows despite being a low-code platform.</li>
                <li>Community Support: Availability of community help and resources to overcome challenges.</li>
            </ul>

            each other.
            <img src="img/assistants.png" alt="System Diagram" class="img-responsive" />
            These are two essential nodes that are crucial to the workflow. The first Notion node retrieves the data,
            then that data gets sent to the OpenAI API and then once processed the data is sent back to another Notion
            database.

            <p>Initially, understanding all functionalities in Notion was challenging, but once mastered, it facilitated
                effective database management and integration with webhooks for automation triggers. Notion's
                comprehensive features allowed for easy implementation in this prototype. Future complex implementations
                might require more detailed research. For more details, refer to the <a

            <ul>
                <li>User-Friendly Interface: Notion provides a robust and easy-to-use interface for managing databases.

            </li>
            <p>OpenAI assistants were integrated to perform specific tasks such as data analysis, content generation,
                and providing actionable insights. These AI-driven assistants leveraged large language models (LLMs) to
                process and analyze large amounts of information, offering valuable support in breaking down complex
                tasks and enhancing overall productivity. I chose OpenAI's GPT-4 model because it is the most capable
                LLM out there right now. The smartest isn't always needed in this system, but GPT-4 does really well at
                understanding concept, thus making it a better candidate for dissecting those concepts as well. . It is
                possible to use another model for further dissection. Next to
                that, I also did a lot of prompt engineering and used the chain of thought method for the
                instructions/prompting for these agents. This led to a really good, structured, and desired output.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The Realisation phase successfully demonstrated the practical benefits of using low-code platforms like
                N8N and Notion, along with AI-driven assistants, in automating and enhancing workflow processes. Notion
                provided a robust and user-friendly interface for database management, while N8N facilitated seamless
                automation and task management. The integration of OpenAI assistants added significant value by
                processing and analyzing data, generating content, and breaking down complex tasks into manageable
                steps.
            </p>
            <p><b>Key takeaways from this phase include:

                </b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>The efficiency and effectiveness of low-code platforms in automating workflows and managing data.
                </li>
                <li>The ease of integrating AI assistants to enhance productivity and provide actionable insights.</li>
                <li>The importance of a well-structured and interconnected database system to support seamless data flow
                    and task management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite some initial challenges in configuring the databases and ensuring consistent model performance,
                the overall outcome was positive. The AI models proved to be effective in dissecting projects into
                smaller tasks, although occasional inconsistencies required adjustments to the prompts and processing
                code. Future improvements could focus on further refining the automation processes and exploring
                additional features within Notion and N8N to enhance scalability and robustness.
            </p>
            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>In the upcoming Evaluation phase, I will evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented
                solutions through rigorous testing. This will involve comparing the AI-generated task breakdowns with
                real-world projects and feedback from team members. The goal is to ensure that the workflows are not
                only functional but also practical and reliable in real-world applications.</p>
